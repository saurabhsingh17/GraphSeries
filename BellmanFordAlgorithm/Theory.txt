Theory:
Bellman ford algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a graph
as dijikstra algorithm is used to find shortest path with positive edge
weights.
If we provide negative edges in dijikstra algorithm then we will be stuck
in infinite loop as every time the edge will decrease
->Bellman ford algorithm will not work for negative cycle graph
->If there is undirected graph then we can convert it into a directed graph
->The advantage of bellman fords negative cycle is that it can detect negative
cycle
Algorithm:
  Relax all the edges n-1 times
 ->if(dist(u)+wt<dis[v])
   dis[v]=dist[u]+wt
-> The order of edges can we in any order
-> If we do the relaxation 1 extra time and still the distance gets reduced then
we can know that the edges have negative cycle.

Time Complexity- O(N-1)*O(E)
Space Complwxity- O(N) distance array
