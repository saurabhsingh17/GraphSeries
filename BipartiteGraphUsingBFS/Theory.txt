Bipartite Definition:
A graph that can be colored using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have same
color.
1. Node in the cycle is odd:- Not bipartite
2. Not Odd :Bipartite

Theory:
We create a color array and put the first element into queue and initialise it with 1.
and we traverse to the elements in the queue and itiliase the first element with node
and pop the value.. we traverse to the adjacent elements of the node..
if it is not colored then we color it else if the color of the adjacent value is
equal to current node color then we return false.
