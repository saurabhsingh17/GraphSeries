Bipartite Definition:
---------------------
A graph that can be colored using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have same
        color.
1. Node in the cycle is odd:- Not bipartite
2. Not Odd :Bipartite

Theory:
----------
We create a color array initialised with -1. We pick the src node and assign the
color as 1 and call the dfs of its adjacent array then again we change the color of
to different than src and check if its adjacent nodes are of different colors
if yes we continue and if there is no color we call the dfs and continue in the
same way until we reach a point where the color is either same or all the nodes are
traversed.
