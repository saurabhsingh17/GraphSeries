Theory:
We use BFS algorith with little modification.. instead of pushing the vertex alone
we push its parent also with the node.. so while traversing if any case comes where
par!=it then we can know that it is cycle only.

Algorithm:
We have a visited vector and adj[] we traverse over the visited array..we put the first
one as (node,-1) and check in the adj list for its adjacent nodes we check if that
particular value in the visited if it is visited and not parent then there is cycle else
we put the node in the queue.
