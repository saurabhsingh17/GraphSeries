Theory:
We create a visited array and start traversing over it
and initialise the first node(1,-1)
and then we tend to look for its adjacent we pick one of the adjacent element
if it is not
already visited then we put it in the queue
and assign 1 to visited array and then we continue in the similar unless we find an
element having it !=parent
