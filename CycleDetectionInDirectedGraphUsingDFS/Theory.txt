Theory:
Earlier cycle detection method doesn't work here as we can have direction which
aren't getting reflected in the visited array.
For overcoming this issue we have come up with an extra array dfsvis there we can
mark dfsvis[node]=1 when we call the traverse function
and similarly while going back we make it as 0.
So if there is cycle then we can have vis[node]==1 as well as dfsvis[node]==1
