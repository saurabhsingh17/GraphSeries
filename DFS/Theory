Theory:
DFS is traversal technique we tend to traverse trough the depth of the graph rather than traversing adjacent
nodes first.

Algorithm:
1.First create a visited array and loop over the element one by one
2.if value is not 0 put the value in the queue and traverse over the adjacency list for that
particular number
