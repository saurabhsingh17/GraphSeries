Theory:
~~~~~~~~
We assign 0 to the src distance and create a priority queue insert the element only
when it has a better distance than the existing. Then we pick the first element
out of the priority queue and check if the distance of there adjacent element is smaller
than the current distance if yes replace the current distance with the new smaller distance.

Time Complexity:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
O((N+E)logn)

Space Complexity:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
O(N) + O(N)
