Theory:
Kosaraju algorithm is used to find strongly connected component
It is based on the intuition of taking transpose of the edges
Time Complexity:O (N+E)
Space Complexity:O(N+E)+O(N)+O(N)

Algo:
1. Sort all edges in order of finishing time- Topo Sort
2. Transpose the graph
3. DFS according to the finishing time.
