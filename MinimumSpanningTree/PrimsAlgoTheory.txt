Theory:
Prims algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree.
In prims algorith we start with the source node and then we visit the node with the
minimum weight and continue to do so .. in the process we cannot have a cycle
and when all the nodes are visited.

Algorithm:
In the prims algo we consider three arrays key, mst , parent initialised with inf, False, -1
When we start we consider the source node as 0 and look for its adjacent nodes and put there
weight in the key array. From the key array we pick the smallest value and mark its value
in mst as true and traverse through the adjacent of the node and replace the values in the
key with the respective weights.Also mark the value in the parent node as the parent one.
Then we check the the nodes that are adjacent to that node and we dont pick any value which
is true in the mst or has lower value in the key already.
