Theory:
Kahn Algorithm:
We have a indegree array and we pick the elements whose indegree is 0 and put it
in the queue.
We take out the first element from the queue and traverse over its adjacent nodes
and reduce there indegree by 1.
And while taking out the element from the queue we put it in the order.
We keep doing that unless the q is empty.
