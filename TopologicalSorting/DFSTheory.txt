Topological Sorting:
--------------------
Linear ordering of vertices such that if there is an edge u -> v
then u appears before v in that ordering.

Points to Remember:
--------------------
1. There can be multiple topological sorting for a given graph.
2. Applicable to Directed Acylic Graph (DAG)

Algorithm:
------------
We create a visited array and traverse from 1 to V and call the DFS assign its
value as 1 and check if there is an adjacent node if no we add it in stack and
end the dfs call if yes then we call the dfs for the adjacent nodes if it is not
visited then we assign 1 and call its adjacent node until we reach a point where
either adjacent node is visited or it has no adjacent nodes at all.
In the end stack represents the order of topological
